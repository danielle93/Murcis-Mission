<h1>Surrending Your Pet</h1>
<hr>
<p>
We understand the difficulty when faced with the decision to give up a beloved pet.
<br><br>
If you can answer <strong>“YES”</strong> to any of the questions below, please take the time to explore those options before surrendering your dog. 
<br><br>
<strong>Did you acquire him as a puppy from a breeder?</strong><br>
If so, have you contacted that person? If he or she is at all reputable, you would have signed a contract at the time you purchased your puppy, stipulating that the dog should be returned if you decide to no longer keep him. If you do not want to keep your dog, contact your breeder first.
<br><br>
<strong>Did you acquire your Dog from a Rescue Organization?</strong><br>
If so, have you contacted that rescue organization? If they are reputable, you would have signed a contract at the time you adopted your dog, and it may stipulate that the dog must be returned to them if you decide to no longer keep him or her for any reason.
<br><br>
<strong>Does your dog need spaying/neutering? </strong><br>
There are many options for low cost spay neuter clinics. Here are a few:

<strong>New baby in the family?</strong><br>
How lucky for you that most dogs are fantastic family pets! If you can take care of your new little human baby, you can take care of a dog. Some of our educational materials are listed below to help you ease the transition:

<br><br>
<strong>Moving?</strong><br>
The Humane Society lists moving as the number one reason people surrender their pets to shelters. There are plenty of apartments, townhouses, condos and hotels that accept medium and large dogs. Many places will even allow you to spread payment of your pet deposit over multiple months as part of your rent. Please check with your real estate agent, or company relocation services when possible.
<br><br>
<strong>Think you don’t have enough time for your dog?</strong><br>
Experts in the animal field agree that a dog requires a mere 15 minutes of one-on-one time with his human per day to be happy, healthy, and well-adjusted! That could be simply spent laying in bed at night watching t.v. together, playing ball in the backyard for 15 minutes while dinner is cooking, or going for a walk or jog! Surely you can spare 15 minutes per day. Pets reduce personal stress and can add years to your life – make the time for you AND your dog.
<br><br>
<strong>Are there behavioral issues?</strong><br>
Is your dog having trouble getting along with other animals in the household or are there other behavioral issues that have led to the decision to give up your dog? If so, let us help you. Send us an email – we can most likely recommend a trainer in your area. If you didn’t socialize your dog as a puppy, it’s never too late to enroll him in obedience school. It’s fun and can count as your 15 minutes of bonding time!
<br><br>
<strong>Experiencing financial issues?</strong><br>
The following groups exist to assist people who truly want to keep their pets, but are experiencing financial difficulties. They may be able to help you.
   <br><br><br>
    <h2>If You Must Surrender Your Pet...</h2>
    
    First, please <a href="/contact.html">contact us to schedule an appointment</a>.

If you have exhausted all other options and have decided to surrender your pet, we are here to help.

We will ask a few questions to help determine if your pet is a good candidate for our adoption program.

    <h3>What to bring:</h3>
<strong>>> Valid photo ID with your current address</strong><br><br>
<strong>>> Pet’s medical records</strong><br>
It is extremely important for you to obtain your animal’s medical records and bring them with you. A lack of medical information can delay the time it takes to evaluate your pet, and thus delay its availability for adoption.<br><br>
<strong>>> Pet personality profile</strong><br>
    We will ask you to fill out a “personality profile” about your pet. The information about its health, behavior, habits, likes, and dislikes is really helpful to people considering your pet for adoption and helps us decide what kind of home would be best for it.
